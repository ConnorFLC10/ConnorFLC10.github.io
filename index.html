							<h3>The Overall Design</h3>
							<p>This design is what we would ideally have for our users. Just a simple and comfy mat that goes nicely onto your chair. It also would have the main circuitry in a casing

							<h3>The Product Casing</h3>
							<p>The casing is a 3D printed cuboid that contains all the main circuitry. This would be secured to the bottom of the user's chair. And the resistive sensors would protrude

							<h3>Is this product really necessary?</h3>
							<!--<p>This is the subtitle for this particular heading</p>-->
						</header>
						<p>Back pain is the number one reason for workers missing work in the United States and among the main reasons for missing work for the rest of the world. This product is aimed at those that spend a majority of their time on a chair infront of a computer. This includes office workers and students. An overwhelming majority of office workers will develop chronic back pain sometime in their life and is always a growing issue all across the world as people are sitting infront of a computer screen for longer periods of time. During these times, it is easy to get distracted and forget about your posture which leads to several long term issues. </p>

							<h3></h3>

						<blockquote>"When you use good posture, your muscles and other structures function properly, helping you to avoid abnormal wear and tear. Improper posture places stress on your joints and can cause them to wear away. This is the most common cause of osteoarthritis, a form of “wear and tear” arthritis. While other factors, such as age and genetics, can increase the risk of arthritis, the way you carry your body plays a role in how much stress you put on your joints. Keeping your body aligned in the proper posture can reduce muscle fatigue and strain and help keep your joints healthy and lubricated." <br> - Barrington Orthopedic Specialists</blockquote>

							<h3>Technical Specifications and Features</h3>
						</header>
						<ul class="default">
							<li>As shown in the diagram above, the circuit is powered by a 9V battery connected to a 5V regulator. </li>
							<li>The pressure sensors are what read inputs or changes in the user's seating position and utilizes a voltage divider in order for the device to decide if an audio cue to remind the user to fix their posture is needed.</li>
							<li>The programming is done with the help of an Arduino nanocontroller.</li>
							<li>The audio cues are also customizable to cater to the user's preferences.</li>
							<li>The mat would ideally be made out of a yoga mat-like material with the thin pressure sensors embedded within the mat.</li>
